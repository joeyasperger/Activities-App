MUST

SHOULD
- Default-install Xmo'd (but allow opt-out)
- Metapackage (post-processing script to dynamically put plugin where it should go)
- bundle mogenerator into Xmo'd plugin bundle
- Undesirable effect when nuke+re-add opened human files. Make source group reload smarter.

NICE

NOTES

DONE
- Add opt-in "xmod" into datamodel's comment field.
